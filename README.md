# MDLParser

Simple and modern library for parsing the Valve model format.  

This is mainly for use in my other projects like VisTrace, and is accompanied by https://github.com/Derpius/BSPParser and https://github.com/Derpius/VTFParser.

Not much abstraction from the underlying structure was possible, so it's not as easy to integrate as BSPParser or VTFParser, but there would be useful information loss otherwise.
