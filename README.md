# MDLParser

Simple and modern library for parsing the Valve model format.  

This is mainly for use in my other projects like VisTrace, and is accompanied by https://github.com/Derpius/BSPParser and https://github.com/Derpius/VTFParser.

Provides complete abstraction from the MDL and related file formats.
